# postscript


After building these for a couple of days, I found two other resources that do a far better job of helping to conceptualize these topics, so I won't be investing any more time in building these out. 

These resources are: 

1. https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/take.html 

> very good resource with jsFiddle examples that you can tweak on your own 


2. https://rxmarbles.com/

> decent resource but should only IMO be used as a supplement to the first resource above. These examples only make sense when seeing the code in context.

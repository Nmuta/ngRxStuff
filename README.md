There are also other resources that can help you further conceptualize these topics. 
These resources are: 

1.https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators

> very good resource with jsFiddle examples that you can tweak on your own 


2. https://rxmarbles.com/

> decent resource but should only IMO be used as a supplement to the first resource above. These examples only make sense when seeing the code in context.
